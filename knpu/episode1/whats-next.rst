What's Next
-----------

Awesome work making it this far, seriously! We've covered all of the most
fundamental parts of REST, and you already know enough to make a really nice
API. But probably not enough to win CodeBattles. The key is to think about 
resources and representations, to test each part of your API, and to do things 
inside your code that will make your API very consistent. Be aware of the world
around you and the rules of REST, but don't be afraid to carefully bend them to 
make your API useable.

So what big things haven't we covered yet? Authentication, Hypermedia and HATEOAS, 
Documentation, Content-Type negotiation, pagination, custom endpoints and a few 
other topics. Knowing these topics will go a long way to understanding the rest 
of the conversation about REST and to help you decide what types of things you want 
to use in your API, and which things might not be needed.

We'll cover these in our next episode. Seeya next time!
