title:  RESTful APIs Episode 3: Documentation
summary: |
    In [Episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest), we learned
    the fundamentals. In  [Episode 2](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest-ep2)
    we took it a step further with linking, HATEOAS and pagination.

    In our last installment, we're talking about API documentation. Huh?
    Yep, unlike a traditional website, if your API docs have missing or
    out-of-date details, your API is just plain un-usable.

    In this tutorial, we'll experiment with an approach to creating a great
    API doc that's actually *reads* information from your code and updates
    dynamically. This is an area of growth: there are a lot of products and
    libraries to help. But there are also a lot of pieces missing - like
    how could I *actually* read my route information dynamically and use
    that in my API docs?

    Scheduled for **Jan 2015**
